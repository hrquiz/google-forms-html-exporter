### Building the frontend
you'll need [node](https://nodejs.org/), [bower](https://bower.io/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

run `npm install`, `bower install` then `./node_modules/.bin/gulp` to build the frontend

### Run on localhost

- Point your browser to `http://localhost:8000`

### Using as tool
You can also use the `./bin/formdress` command as a local tool to export Google Forms as json objects.
